# Computer Vision
## Author: Rohan Singh
This is a Computer Vision repository using OpenCV, currently the source code uses the Python library for OpenCV, in the future I may add source code for the C++ library of OpenCV. The source code is divided into different repositories for different use cases of Computer Vision. This repository contains an **Introduction** directory that contains basic source code for you to learn how to use the OpenCV library in Python.  

The directories in this repository are:  
  - **Introduction:** This is an introductory project for using the opencv library in python. This directory contains basic gui code using opencv, such as accessing cameras, displaying/capturing images and videos, and other drawing tools of opencv.  
  - **Image Processing:** This repository contains python source code for basic image editing and processing using OpenCV.  
  - **Raspberry pi project:** This is an opencv project specifically designed for a raspberry-pi based computer vision project.  

## Setup
To set up open cv for python on your device please follow these steps:  
  - **Download Python:** install the latest version of Python from:  
    > https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - **Install the opencv library:** install the opencv library using the following command on your cmd/terminal:  
    > python3 -m pip install opencv-python  
  - **Test:** to check if everything went fine, please run the *main.py* script in the root directory of this repository.
